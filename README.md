# EchelonX – The Most Advanced Encryption System
🚀 Echelon X is an enterprise-grade, multi-layered encryption framework designed to protect sensitive data with military-grade security. Combining AES-GCM, RSA-4096, Shamir’s Secret Sharing, TPM-based encryption, and cloud-integrated key management, Echelon X is built for maximum security, resilience, and speed.

⚡ Key Features

-Multi-Layered Encryption: AES-GCM for file content, AES-SIV for filenames, RSA-4096 for key protection.
 
-Shamir’s Secret Sharing: Securely splits encryption keys across multiple shares to prevent single-point failure.
 
-TPM Integration: Hardware-backed key security using Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

-Hybrid Key Management: Secure key storage with TPM & AWS Secrets Manager backup.

-Parallelized File Encryption: High-speed encryption using multiprocessing & adaptive batching.

-Integrity Protection & Tamper Detection: Prevents unauthorized modifications and ensures data authenticity.

-Self-Destruction Mechanism: If tampering is detected, encryption keys can be automatically erased.

🔐 Security Architecture
Echelon X follows a 10-layer security model, making it one of the most advanced encryption systems:

🔹 Layer 1-3: AES-GCM for file content, filenames, and metadata.

🔹 Layer 4-5: Shamir’s Secret Sharing + RSA-4096 key protection.

🔹 Layer 6-7: TPM-based encryption for key storage.

🔹 Layer 8-9: AWS Secrets Manager backup + secure memory wiping.

🔹 Layer 10: Tamper detection & self-healing.
